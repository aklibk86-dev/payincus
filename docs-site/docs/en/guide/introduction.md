## Main Capabilities

- User portal for accounts, instances, terminal access, wallet, tickets, notifications and self-service modules.
- Admin console for users, billing, payments, hosts, images, settings, logs and OTA updates.
- Backend API for authentication, billing, Incus delivery, Agent reporting and notification delivery.
- Host Agent for heartbeat, capacity, instance state and traffic reporting.
- Production verification scripts for split hosts, route boundaries, response headers and live acceptance.

## Production Rule

Local tests and build-time guards are necessary, but production readiness still requires real live proof for payments, Incus operations, Agent reporting, SMTP, Lsky and notification delivery.
